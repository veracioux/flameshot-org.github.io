## Installation on macOS (OSXI)

You can install Flameshot on [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) using the either of the following:

- [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/flameshot/summary): `sudo port selfupdate && sudo port install flameshot`
- [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/flameshot): `brew install --cask flameshot`
- Download DMG file:
    1. Navigate to [the release page on Github](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/releases)
    2. From the assets of the latest stable release, download the latest DMG file
    3. Double-click on the DMG file you downloaded
    4. Drag and drop the `flameshot.app` to your `/Applications` folder
    5. MacOS restricts applications from accessing the screen. Therefore you have to give Flameshot security permissions to "record" your desktop.
