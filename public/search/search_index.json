Flameshot doesn't yet offer a fully-automated option to do so, but you can configure your system to do so. On KDE Plasma desktop \u00b6 To make configuration easier, there's a file in the repository that more or less automates this process.

Steps for using the configuration: The configuration file configures shortcuts so that Flameshot automatically saves (without opening the save dialog) screenshots to ~/Pictures/Screenshots folder. Make sure you have that folder by running the following command: mkdir -p ~/Pictures/Screenshots (If you don't like the default location, you can skip this step and configure your preferred directory later.) Download the configuration file: cd ~/Desktop ; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/master/docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde Go to System Settings \u2192 Shortcuts \u2192 Custom Shortcuts . If there's one, you'll need to disable an entry for Spectacle, the default KDE screenshot utility first because its shortcuts might collide with Flameshot's ones; so, just uncheck the Spectacle entry.

Sometimes you will find a quick solution just by reading the threads. In case of feature request, if you find someone with similar idea, just give that a thumbs-up to increase its priority/importance. In case you didn't find similar issue, create a new issue and explain in details what the issue is. If you can, add pictures or video recordings to clarify the situation. For bug reports, make sure to also visit issue reporting page in which we have explained how to get the information we need in each bug report. Linux \u00b6 In System tray area, flameshot appears duplicate icons/indicator \u00b6 It is currently found in Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 Unity environment, such problems occur. This problem does not occur with Ubuntu 17.10 Unity. #92 In Gnome the flameshot icon does not appear in the tray \u00b6 Gnome does not have a systray, therefore in Gnome you should install the gnome Tray icons extension. For more information, read the Tary icon section of the github repository. In tiling window managers (e.g i3wm, dwm, bspwm) flameshot crashes when taking the screenshot \u00b6 most tiling window managers dows not come with a nitification daemon, and Flameshot communicates with user through notifications. This means that Flameshot is dependent on notification manager to be installed and running. Easy way to test if you have a notification manager is to try notify-send \"test\" in your terminal. If you see the notification, you have it, otherwise we suggest you to install a notification manager such as dunst : https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/1179#issuecomment-757544326 Flameshot icon is visible in tray area but when I click on it nothing happens \u00b6 First try the using the command flameshot gui in terminal. This does exactly what clicking on the tray icon does. (make sure can you see Flameshot icon in the tray area) If the above step didn't work: Open 3 terminals Kill Flameshot if it is already open using pkill flameshot In the first terminal run dbus-monitor --session sender=org.flameshot.Flameshot In the second terminal run flameshot In the third terminal run flameshot gui Copy the content of the first terminal in pastebin: https://bin.snopyta.org/ Post the link in the issue on Github macOS \u00b6 All opened applications go away and only the blank desktop is visible for selection \u00b6 As it has been reported multiple times already ( 1 , 2 ), macOS restricts applications from accessing the screen. Therefore you have to give Flameshot security permissions to \"record\" your desktop.
